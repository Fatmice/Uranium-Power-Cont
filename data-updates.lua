-- Compat for Bob's.  This replaces all of UP's oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen requiring or proving recipes to use Bob's equivalent gasses.
-- Technological locks are still in place so for people playing with Bob's they must still pass over his hurdles, if required, to get at the gasses as well as UP's.
-- Compat for Angel's is implicit since his mod provides a doodad that can covert Bob's gasses into Angel's.
